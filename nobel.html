We look at things like trends, patterns, and info about the winners to understand how things have changed over time. By looking at stuff like whether winners are men or women, how old they are, where they're from, and what they did, we learn about how things are changing in the world. This helps us celebrate the people who made big changes and see how our world is getting better in different ways. </p>
